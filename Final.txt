Over the next two weeks, you will be working on building your own API. The API can be anything you want, as long as it doesn't violate any school policies. Your API must meet the following, minimum requirements:
Contain at least 5 entities
Contain all CRUD operations
Contain at least 1 one-to-many relationship
Contain at least 1 many-to-many relationship
Contain different application layers including at least controller, service, and repository
